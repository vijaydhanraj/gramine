## fixme: this test doesn't help much unless you inspect the generated code
## you shouldn't see multiple aliases for _buffer_write or _filter_function
## and you should only resolve $test_x once, preferably before the loop
## broken: unify hoisting of alias and resolved placeholders
#for $x in [1, 2]
  #if $x == 2
    #if $resolve_test_x == 'resolve_test_x1'
      Success
    #else
      Expected error
    #end if
  #else
    $resolve_test_x
  #end if
#end for
